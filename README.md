PopcornPal is an in-development social network designed to help movie lovers keep track of what films they want to see, form groups, and watch them.

## Dicsovery

PopcornPal hopes to end the phenomenon of endless Netflix scrolling and encourage the casual film watcher to give a chance to films that they otherwise would have been skeptical of or perhaps not even know about. At PopcornPal, we believe that trailers and hype are not the best way to determine whether a movie will be any good. We believe we can make better recommendations based off deep insights about the people and circumstances involved in making the movie. Elements like the actors, director, writer, and budget give a much more insightful read into the DNA of the movie.

## Social

Everybody enjoys watching movies and yet we rarely watch them together or even discuss them. PopcornPal is an online community designed to help us understand our own movie preferences and those of our friends so that it can encourage people to sit down together and roll the film. It encourages the recommendation and discussion of movies and strives to add social pressure to broadening one's horizons both with what they watch, and who they watch with.

## Professional and Creative

PopcornPal is also a place for filmmakers and critics who hope to share their work with a large and enthusiastic community of film lovers. Critics are able to host all their reviews on PopcornPal and easily maintain a page that is professional, and accessible. They should be able to reach readers and viewers from around the world and build a following of fans eager to consume their content. Likewise, those who make films can use PopcornPal to generate buzz and word of mouth for their work. PopcornPal strives to serve the needs of these kinds of content creators all the way from the solo hobbyist up to full time professionals and organizations.
